## **A Comparative Study on the Feasibility of Graph-based Recommendation Systems**  
Authors: Sharjeel Mustafa & George Kaceli

### **Introduction**
In the digital age, attention is a key driver of economic success. Whether it’s a poster, a product, or a book, capturing a potential customer’s attention can be the deciding factor in whether they choose to engage or walk away. As a result, recommender systems play a critical role in personalizing content per user and converting them into a sale. In this work, we investigate a broad spectrum of recommender system designs, focusing on the feasibility of leveraging graph-based approaches to more effectively utilize relational information. Recommender systems are typically categorized into three main types: content-based, collaborative filtering, and hybrid models. We evaluate a diverse range of graph-based models alongside established methods from each category. Notably, the graph-based NGCF model slightly outperforms its non-graph-based counterparts, even when applied to data that is not inherently graph-structured, thereby demonstrating the broader applicability and potential of graph-based methods in general recommendation scenarios.
